# bcr_pie_project
Operational Improvement Project for BCR

This Python script is designed to facilitate data entry for a pie production process. The user inputs the number of boxes produced for each pie flavor and size, and the script calculates the total number of pies produced and displays the data in a user-friendly format. The data is also automatically loaded into a Google Sheet for record-keeping purposes. The script uses Streamlit for the front-end interface and Google Sheets API for the backend.
